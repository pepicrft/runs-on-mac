# Runs-On-Mac

A Disney-style storytelling site about the history of CI, mobile CI, and the runs-on revolution.

## Setup

This project uses [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for managing Node.js and pnpm versions.

```bash
# Install dependencies
mise install
pnpm install
```

## Development

```bash
# Start the development server
pnpm start
```

Visit http://localhost:8080 to view the site.

## Build

```bash
# Build the static site
pnpm build
```

The output will be in the `_site` directory.

## Story

This site tells the tale of how CI evolved from monolithic mobile CI platforms to the modern era of decoupled runners, where changing providers is as simple as updating a single line in your configuration.
